# My Text User Interface (MYTUI)


## Motivation

I needed a simple UI library for a few projects. Unfortunately, nothing suited my needs, so I rolled my own.
Here is what stand this project from others:

1. Very easy API
1. Does not enforce using own event loop
1. Supports Python 3
1. Clear code structure meant for extending (if needed)


## Limitations

1. It was designed for single form applications.
1. Widgets currently have fixed size and cannot overdraw each other. So:
    1. No layers
    1. No drop-down menus, etc


## How to use
